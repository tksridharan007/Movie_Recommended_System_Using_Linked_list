# Movie_Recommended_System_Using_Linked_list
Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time and wanted to complete their work on the faster time. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.
The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual.
